# Overview

Hello world! My name is Kelton Webb. I enjoy learning different languages and concepts to help me pursue my dream career in cybersecurity! I enjoy making my own tools (especially in python) to help me understand more while I study.

The program here is just a simple Hello World game I made in python.

I made this repository as a simple introduction for a little about me and how my work on Github will be shared. This submission is the first of many more advanced one to come!

I will also share videos to explain the project like this one below.
